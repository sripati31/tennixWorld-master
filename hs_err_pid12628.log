# Native memory allocation (mmap) failed to map 134217728 bytes for Failed to commit area from 0x0000000081200000 to 0x0000000089200000 of length 134217728.
# Possible reasons:
#   The system is out of physical RAM or swap space
#   The process is running with CompressedOops enabled, and the Java Heap may be blocking the growth of the native heap
# Possible solutions:
#   Reduce memory load on the system
#   Increase physical memory or swap space
#   Check if swap backing store is full
